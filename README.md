INTRODUCTION
------------

The Simple Policy extension simplifies the privacy policies of large companies to help users make informed decisions regarding the use of those sites' platforms.

DISCLAIMER
----------

**Note: This is a beta version of Simple Policy. In future updates we hope to include the design, quality, and verifiability of the information.**

While the information provided on Simple Policy is gathered on the companies' websites, some of the information we collect may be incomplete and/or biased. We do not have an established methodology for our ratings (from "Very Poor" to "Very Good"), so we recommend that users do separate research to arrive at their own conclusions. We create ratings for the following categories:

- What Information the Company Can Access
- With Whom the Company Can Share the Data
- Privacy Policy Changes the Company Can Implement

When applicable, we link privacy policy settings for the various companies on our extension -- however, some of these pages can only be accessed if the user has an account. For the database breaches, we are careful to list our sources, so users are free to verify our findings.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

Since this is a Chrome extension, you have to use Google Chrome for the extension to work. Additionally, not all news sites are indexed - however, if you find a site you want Open Lens to add, please contact us at <a href="mailto:research@openlens.net?subject=Add ___ to Simple Policy">research@openlens.net</a>.

FAQ
---

**Why should I install this extension?**

You should install this extension to obtain simple, consolidated information on companies' privacy policies.

Given that many companies have overly complicated privacy policies to account for many small nuances in their regulations, everyday users often have trouble understanding the basics of the company's policies.

We hope that our tool can support their research and encourage users to make informed decision-making.

**How should I use this tool?**

You should use this tool to obtain simplified information about a company's privacy policy. Given that the chrome extension cannot handle all of the information given in the company's documents, we encourage users to use Simple Policy as a tool to supplement further research.
